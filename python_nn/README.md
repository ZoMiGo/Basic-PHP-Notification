# Simple Neural Network Example

This folder contains a standalone Python script demonstrating a basic feedforward neural network trained on the XOR problem. The implementation uses only the Python standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.

The network consists of an input layer with two neurons, one hidden layer with four neurons and sigmoid activation, and an output layer with one neuron.

## Usage

Run the script to train the network (20â€¯000 iterations) and display predictions:

```bash
python3 python_nn/neural_network.py
```
